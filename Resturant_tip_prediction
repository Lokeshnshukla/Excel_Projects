# 🧮 Predicting Restaurant Tips using Excel Regression

This is an end-to-end predictive analytics project where we use **Multiple Linear Regression** in **Microsoft Excel** to predict **restaurant tips** based on variables like `total_bill`, `size`, and encoded categorical features.  

✅ Built as part of my **Data Analyst Certification** from **Simplilearn**.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

Predict the `tip` amount a customer will leave based on:

- Gender (`sex_encoded`)
- Smoking status (`smoker_encoded`)
- Day (`day_encoded`)
- Time (`time_encoded`)
- Group size (`size`)
- Total bill amount (`total_bill`)

## 📊 Regression Formula (from Excel Output)


Tip = 0.672 + 0.192 × Size + 0.093 × Total_Bill

## 📈 RMSE Formula Used

```excel

=SQRT(AVERAGE((Actual_Tip - Predicted_Tip)^2))
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): ≈ 1.015

R² (Coefficient of Determination): 0.467

Adjusted R²: 0.462

Multiple R (Correlation): 0.683

🧾 Key Insights
📈 Group Size and Total Bill have the strongest positive impact on tip amount.

🔍 Categorical features (sex, smoker, day, time) show lower correlation.

✅ Significance F < 0.05 — model is statistically significant.
